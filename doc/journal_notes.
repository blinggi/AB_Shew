August 2
received new data files from Meng. These have the Spu* annotations instead of the mix that they were before.
Redo code to import these. Files are names 'data_spu*'

get different annotation file. "ShewW3181_annots_042513.csv" from xls file

at finishing,
all looks good for now
some outputs:
> cor(Lactate_CC , Shew_HL_HO2)[1] 0.9693649> cor(Lactate_CC,C_lim_CC)[1] 0.3958515> cor(Shew_HL_HO2,C_lim_CC)[1] 0.40397

don't know whether he would expect this.
do some qa before sending it to him on monday 

scatter plot done in ggplot2, will work on putting this in code next time
-----------------------------

Checked above correlations with raw .xls file. Match up. Corrleations very close which means that the normazlaition is very close.

Add fold change calculations to output for alex and check that annotations are correctly matched. 

do fold change calc. then add annotations. need to make any zero value to .1

finished all. 
Summary
final R output is put in "output" folder. This will require some polishing.
polishing: get rid of data with no IDs
show less decimals
color code sections
add cover sheet
add spaces and justifications to make pretty
(fixed the way the data was divided a couple of places in fold.chage.R code)
_______________________

wrote some code to filter based on total counts (to get rid of low count genes) and also to see only genes that are regulated 2 fold or more (+/-) in at least 1 comparison.
so far this is just an add on to already outputted data, but could put it in workflow easily.
is called 'filter.R'
